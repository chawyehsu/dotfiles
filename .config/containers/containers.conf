# The containers configuration file specifies all of the available configuration
# command-line options/flags for container engine tools like Podman & Buildah,
# but in a TOML format that can be easily modified and versioned.

# Please refer to containers.conf(5) for details of all configuration options.
# Not all container engines implement all of the options.
# All of the options have hard coded defaults and these options will override
# the built in defaults. Users can then override these options via the command
# line. Container engines will read containers.conf files in up to three
# locations in the following order:
#  1. /usr/share/containers/containers.conf
#  2. /etc/containers/containers.conf
#  3. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/containers/containers.conf or
#     $HOME/.config/containers/containers.conf if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set
#  Items specified in the latter containers.conf, if they exist, override the
# previous containers.conf settings, or the default settings.

[containers]
# Set default DNS servers.
# This option can be used to override the DNS configuration passed to the
# container. The special value "none" can be specified to disable creation of
# /etc/resolv.conf in the container.
# The /etc/resolv.conf file in the image will be used without changes.

# http_proxy, https_proxy, ftp_proxy, no_proxy, and the upper case versions of
# these. This option is needed when host system uses a proxy but container
# should not use proxy. Proxy environment variables specified for the container

[network]
# The name of the default network as seen in `podman network ls`. This option only effects the network assignment when
# the bridge network mode is selected, i.e. `--network bridge`. It is the default for rootful containers but not as
