# Prevent VHDX file to exceed a certain amount, to limit the maximum size that a
# distribution file system is allowed to take up. The default value is `1TB`.
#
# Note that this config won't take effect on existing distributions/VHDX [1], so
# you may need to delete existing distributions and re-install them to apply this
# config.

# This config was initially introduced to work around the vmmem high CPU usage
# issue [1] of WSL2 date from late 2021. There were discussions about this issue
# being (potentially) caused by WSLg (first introduced in Apr 2021, officially
# released in Windows 10 build 21364).
#
# WSLg did not support Windows 10 until Windows 10 21H1 with the November 2022
# update KB5020030 [2][3]. This config takes effect only on Windows versions that
# support WSLg. (Also note that the WSL component in Microsoft Store supports
# Windows 20H1 -- version 2004, build 19043, and later [4].)
#
# This config was also used as a workaround for the issue WSLg msrdc spamming
# huge logs [5][6][7].
